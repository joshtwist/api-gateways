        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The first wave of API Gateways, historically, were offered as a
          component within larger API Management platforms. As the industry
          evolved, a new wave of API Gateways were introduced to provide
          solutions to a changing landscape. Some of these gateway providers are
          now supplementing their standalone offering with additional tools,
          often centered around a management approach more conducive to internal
          API lifecycles.

            Presented here is a comprehensive, yet not entirely exhaustive, list
            of popular API Gateways in use today. A few areas of research have
            been highlighted:

        <h2>Why use an API Gateway?</h2>
        <p>
          API Gateways are often a means of centralizing control between API
          Producers and Consumers. This can take a few different shapes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Creating a fa√ßade pattern to present a RESTful API in front of
            legacy services.
          </li>
          <li>Enforcing authentication and authorization.</li>
          <li>Rate limiting traffic.</li>
          <li>
            Routing to static or dynamic targets (e.g., phased rollouts, canary
            deployments).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Real-world API Gateway deployments</h2>
        <p>
          While many API Gateways are looking to cover both the external and
          internal use cases associated with APIs, it's often common these days
          to see multiple gateways deployed inside a single environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, this may take the form of a first-wave gateway platform
          such as <Link to="/gateways/apigee-edge">Apigee Edge</Link> for
          external APIs and more lightweight alternatives, such as{" "}
          <Link to="/gateways/kong/">Kong</Link>, for internal use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          This multi-gateway reality is becoming a new normal for API
          practitioners today.
