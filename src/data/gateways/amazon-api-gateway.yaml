    Amazon is one of the first cloud providers to offer an API Gateway.  
    The gateway supports a few different options: HTTP, REST, and WebSockets.  
    Integrations with other AWS services are abundant.  Amazon API Gateway 
    includes a set of [OpenAPI extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-swagger-extensions.html) 
    to make integration more seamless.
